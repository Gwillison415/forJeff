# Hi Jeff
Should you choose to clone down, an ```npm i``` will allow you to run the test file

## Testing
```npm run test``` will allow you to run the test file I used to validate my code

The assertion library is [Chai](http://chaijs.com/)
And the test runner /framework is [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
